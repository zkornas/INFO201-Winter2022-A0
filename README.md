#### Why this topic?
I decided to focus my research on homelessness, specifically racial disparities amongst homeless populations in the United States. This issue is very prevalent on the West Coast, as homeless people across the country tend to migrate West for more suitable weather and easier access to social services. I started my research by googling _"Data visualization of homelessness rates compared to race"_. I found my [primary visualization](/images/a0-visualizations/primary-visualization.png) that shows the rate of homelessness of African Americans compared to that of Caucasians in each state. I then explored [endhomelessness.org](https://endhomelessness.org/resource/racial-inequalities-homelessness-numbers/) further and found my [secondary visualization](/images/a0-visualizations/secondary-visualization.jpg) that shows the percentage of homelessness made up by multiple minority groups. It was interesting to see that each racial group apart from Asians and Caucasians made up a significantly larger portion of the homeless population compared to their proportion to the US population.

#### What does the data visualization show?
My primary visualization from [endhomelessness.org](https://endhomelessness.org/new-data-on-race-ethnicity-and-homelessness/) shows the ratio of homelessness of African Americans compared to that of Caucasians in each state. The graphic shows that African Americans are more likely to experience homelessness in _**every**_ single state. This draws attention to the fact that there is an apparent systematic issue causing people of color to consistently be at increased risk of homelessness across the country.

- **Who**: This visualization was produced by The National Alliance to End Homelessness[^1]

- **Date**: August 2, 2019

- **Stakeholders**: The audience for this is the general public to educate them on racial disparities in homelessness that may not be obvious. Policy makers are also the target for this data visualization, as the group who created the visualization is aiming to end homelessness.

- **Interests**: The goal of this data visualization is to inform the general public, which will hopefully persuade policy makers and voters to push for change. People often think that homelessness is a result of laziness or an inability to work, this graphic aims to debunk that myth and show that there is a systematic issue at play.

- **Key fact**: From this data visualization we can see that African American people in the United States are consistently at higher risk to face homelessness across all states. It hints towards a systemic issue that is oppressing African American people in the US.

- **Power**: This data visualization shows a clear structural oppresion in our society, where African Americans are facing systemic homelessness across the country. While the graphic does not show what is the exact cause, it is clear that this repeated pattern in every state is not a coincidence.

#### Data Feminism: What I learned?
>**Data Feminism**:  A way of thinking about
data, both their uses and their limits, that is informed by direct experience, by a commitment to action, and by intersectional feminist thought.[^2]

In this assignment I learned that data science can go beyond the analysis of numbers and statistics, which is what I previously assumed it is. Data science can be used to share information as knowledge which can aim to make serious societal, cultural, and political impact. I am excited to continue to learn about data science and data feminism. :bar_chart:
